When life gets busy or you’re low on rest, your cravings can be a sign that it's time to slow down and take care of yourself. If you're not sleeping enough, this can cause an imbalance in your hunger hormones, which can lead to cravings during the day, especially for red meat, cheese or caffeine. And if you've over-exerted yourself, you might also be craving salty foods."

If you're struggling with your sleep, eating foods that won't cause an energy crash like eggs, vegetables, nuts and seeds will help in the short term. Long term, working on your sleep hygiene and dealing with any insomnia can also help. For over-exertion, taking plenty of time to rest, eat well and do some activities that help you feel recharged. You should also drink plenty of water throughout the day and before and after exercise to curb cravings for salty foods."

For example, cravings for savoury foods are often linked to a need for more sodium or protein in your diet. Increased hunger can even be a sign of dehydration! If you're getting these cravings, it's time to listen to what your body asks for. "

Even if you eat healthily most of the time, skipping meals or going too long between meals can cause glucose levels to plummet, leading to sweet food cravings. If you're noticing frequent cravings, it might be time to change up your nutrition. Make sure to eat a range of different foods so your body can get what it needs."

A handful of berries can satisfy you without overindulging and help you meet your recommended intake of fruit and veg. Remember, breaking even one routine can start a ripple effect."
